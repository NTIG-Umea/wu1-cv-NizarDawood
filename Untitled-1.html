      <p> Hello Mcdonalds.   
 It is me, SpongeBob. I lived in bikini bottom but now I have moved to New York City and I
am looking for a new job here in New York. I am 35 years old and I have an 
exceedingly kind personality. I like to help other people. In my free time,
I like to be with my friends Patrick and catch jellyfish and blow bubbles. 
I found your advertisement when I was walking around in times squares.
